I took a small hiatus from the Flatiron curriculum after landing an internship at a contractor for Fortune 500 clients.  I spent 9 months learning C# with .NET and PHP with Yii (1.1 ugh).  Actually getting into production code, let alone databases that size, was not only a gut check but a huge confidence boost.  The team I work with has a pretty laissez-faire attitude about their junior programmers, but I like pressure, so having to bootstrap my own skills in an agile environment was a rewarding challenge.

Coming back to this Flatiron project in Rails went smoothly, and since I've been working this app for a couple months I had most of what I needed stubbed out.

It was basically just a matter of writing the JQuery listeners and building the partials, scripts, JS Objects and making the magic happen.

I did have some stumbling blocks, like:

* random pages not loading the asset pipeline,
* jquery delegated events,
* making nested resources link_to render properly in the new pipeline,

But I'm going to write separate blog posts for those.  

Having professional coding experience has helped my debugging skills exponentially.  In the beginning of my  journey errors used to deeply discourage me.  I daresay I suffered from a spot of impostor's syndrome.   On the tail end of long coding sessions I may struggle a bit, but compared to debugging custom-written modules in Fortune 500 spaghetti code written over 10 years by who knows how many different people in another language with almost no comments and less than enthusiastic mentors + zero concern for standardization.... solving Rails / JS errors for my own app is like taking a bubble bath! 

This experience also helped me realize much faster when debugging various Flatiron  labs that it's not my code that's wrong, it's theirs!  Multiple labs with specs that don't even begin to run right bc they're just copy pasted from completely unrelated lessons, or other obviously wrong nonsense with flagged issues over a year old.  

Anyway.

God I love coding.
