I came to coding gradually over the last couple years, although the reasons that I should do it were always there for me.  After seeing the work one of my Comp Sci friends was doing, I thought I should have majored in that, and not psychology.  Plus, I had switched from Mechanical Engineering after my first semester, and I was starting to regret not having a technical degree.  Alas, I was 3 years in by that point and didn't want to start over, so I stuck with it.

Fast forward almost a decade, and while I don’t regret having a degree in psychology, I hadn’t found a path that really lights my fire.  That is, until I revisited computer science.  The benefits of knowing how to code are, in my opinion pretty much limitless.  Not only do you have an extremely marketable skill, but coding is a great way to stay mentally sharp.

Learning to code has changed the way I think, and I love it.  Breaking things down into logical steps, writing the code, and seeing it work is deeply satisfying.  Not only that, but the skill translates into making real life products and services.  My grandfather was a mechanical engineer who worked on the first commercial jet engines, and the Minuteman II ICBM.  I have mixed feelings about his involvement with a real life doomsday device, but the fact remains that as an engineer, he had a huge impact on the world that will endure into perpetuity.  I share this goal.

So why learn to code?  Besides it being fun and deeply satisfying, for someone like me who’s looking for a career change, it’s the perfect path.  Low entry costs and high benefits.  Plus, I’m a big believer in exercise, be it mental, physical or spiritual.  Learn to code!
